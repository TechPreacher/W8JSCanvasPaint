W8JS-Canvas-Paint is a HTML5 Windows 8 Metro style app that allows the user to paint on a blank screen or a selected image using three colors. Pictures can also be exported to apps that handle images.

canvas.js is adapted from wiliammalone's excellent "Create a Drawing App with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript" project. (http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-drawing-app/).
